# --------- Running the project --------- #
1. Extract the folder at a suitable location.
2. unzip the Data_Set.zip in the same folder.
2. Download the pre-requisites
3. go to the folder and run the New_Model.py file.
4. It will train the model and print the results.
5. The best trained model will get saved in CNN folder can be used for evaluation.
